\section{Mark justification}
\subsection{Martin}
Now, I don't like giving grades to myself since I am quite self-critical. But this time, I know that I gave it my all. I went through all the topics covered in the course material. I proved my abilities in either the Case Study project, in the assignments, or both. Not only did I learn so many things, but I delved deep into them, deep enough so I could find AWS documentation inconsistencies and loopholes. I took a risk to create a project that isn't so common instead of going the easy path of bland overused concepts. And I do not regret it since I learned so much. Technically, some things don't work but we couldn't foresee such outcomes since we implemented everything as AWS suggests. So, in the end, I am proud of the results and evaluate myself at least at a Proficient level.

\section{Individual reflections}
\subsection{Martin}
\subsubsection{Stong points}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Being responsible.
	\item Ensuring quality over quantity.
	\item Validating information sources.
	\item Learning services that enterprises use, although they are out of scope.
	\item Not relying on step-by-step tutorials and AI models.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Weak points}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Relying too much on the documentation (AWS tends to sugarcoat their products) - I had some occurrences where I could have saved so much time by just reading a simple forum thread about a service I am about to use.
	\item At some point, I lost sight of the bigger picture because I was over-optimizing.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Learning moments}

Throughout the semester, I had countless opportunities to hone my troubleshooting skills.

I also learned to not concentrate too much on the researching aspect of a project since documentation takes you so far. You will know if a service could be useful once you start utilizing it. And not just using it, but most importantly - breaking it.

\subsubsection{Improvements for the next project}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Benefit from some real-world opinions synthesized by experience before you start researching or implementing something. 
    \item Start small and simple and go from there. Don't throw yourself in a sea full of things you haven't even heard of.
    \item Don't forget the end goal - the project should have an overall completeness.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Evgeni}
\subsubsection{Stong points}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Always present and took part in all parts of the project.
	\item Does his part of the work.
	\item Communicate with the teammates.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Weak points}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Takes too much time to research (dives too deep).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Learning moments}

The entire semester was a learning opportunity because I was constantly researching and troubleshooting Evaluation of spent effort: I did my tasks and took part as much as I could. I think I did everything I could do on the project and I can say that I spent a good amount of time working on it every week.


\subsubsection{Improvements for the next project}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Research in a more optimal way without spending too much time on the side tasks.
    \item Be more focused on the goal.
    \item Improve my communication with the stakeholders (reply to emails more often and check the mailbox).
\end{itemize}
